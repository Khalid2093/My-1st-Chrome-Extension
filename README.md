# My-1st-Chrome-Extension
This is the first chrome extension I have created by myself from scratch. It is an extension for predicting age of a person based on the education and work experience by parsing huge json data. I have written the backend using flask which is an python framework. It was a great experience and learning.
# How to Use
1) git clone the remote url of the repository.
2) Run the server.py in the backend folder using python server.py. 
3) Load the unpacked extension.
4) Upvote ðŸ˜Š.
